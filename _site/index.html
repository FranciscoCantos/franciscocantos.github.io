      <p>Hi, I’m Francisco Cantos and also a senior iOS applications developer. I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and multiple skills.</p>

<p>I am a very restless person who always likes to learn new things. When I master a subject I like to share it with anyone who wants to learn. At work I am always willing to help my colleagues in everything they need.</p>

<p>I am passionate about technological advances and I like to try everything. I get informed about these advances in several RSS, social networks and newsletters.</p>

</p><p>I started my path in Storybeat because I was looking for a bigger challenge than the ones already had and the experience has been exciting.</p>

<p>During this time I have performed tasks such as analysis and development of new features with the product team, testing with <mark>XCTests</mark>, redesign of screens, queries to <mark>REST-APIs</mark> using <mark>URLSession</mark>, manages purchases and subscriptions in App-Store, translations with <mark>Lokalise</mark>, uploads to the App-Store, make error analysis with <mark>Crashlitics</mark>, check analytics with <mark>Firebase</mark>, <mark>Xcode-Cloud</mark> implementation, use the <mark>AppleMusic</mark> API, deliver remote and local notifications, use of UserDefaults, audio and video editing with <mark>AVFundation</mark>, ads integration with Google <mark>AdMob</mark>… 
All this using a Redux architecture (Unidirectional Data Flow) with the <mark>ReSwift</mark> framework. We also use tools like <mark>Swiftlint</mark>, <mark>Periphery</mark>, <mark>Cocoapods</mark>, <mark>SPM</mark>, <mark>Figma</mark>, <mark>Purchasely</mark>, <mark>Firebase</mark>, <mark>Google-SignIn</mark>, <mark>Kingfisher</mark>, <mark>Lottie</mark>, <mark>SwiftGen</mark>, <mark>Lottie</mark>…</p>

<p>The atmosphere with my teammates is great and this is very important when you are remote. We have our own Kanban and we get along great with <mark>Jira</mark> and <mark>Github</mark>. The review of PRs was extensive among teammates of the same platform and this greatly improved the quality of the code and avoided errors. Also in each release we have to do like Quality Assurance to check in our own hands the quality of the development.
Every month we took turns to be in charge of online teambuildings and the organization of retrospective meetings to know the status of the team members and introduce improvements according to the whole team.</p>

<p>We also had the opportunity to contribute to the Roadmap of the app.</p>

</p><p>During this stage I was in 2 different companies; in my first stage I was hired through the company Alten and after 9 months I had a change of supplier to Qaracter.</p>

<p>At Vodafone I started right at the beginning of the pandemic; it was my first contact with 100% remote work. There I was part of the Transactional team where we developed different functionalities to facilitate the process of acquiring discounts by the customer.</p>

<p>The app is developed in Swift code, with an MVP architecture. For error control and code quality control, unit tests are performed with <mark>XCTest</mark>. We use tools such as <mark>SwiftLint</mark>, <mark>Kiuwan</mark> and <mark>SonarQube</mark> to increase code quality.
Task management was done with Jira using Scrum methodology in 3-week sprints. Between the different teams we reviewed each other’s PRs to test that everything was OK.</p>

</p><p>The development of this app I used reactive programming using the <mark>RXSwift</mark> framework and a <mark>VIPER</mark> architecture. Unit tests were performed with <mark>XCTEst</mark> and also we used <mark>SonarQube</mark> and <mark>Swiftlint</mark> to increase code quality.
The task management was performed with <mark>Azure</mark> and <mark>Scrum</mark> as agile methodology. The app was separated into different frameworks that contained the different logics to improve compilation and testing times.</p>

<p>The developers were divided into 3 teams of 3 people; 2 teams from InnoCV and one from another company, who managed their own tasks and responsibilities. The PRs were reviewed among the different team members. Also in each team we had a QA to improve the quality of the product.</p>
